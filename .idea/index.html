<h1>Dropout Prevention Database</h1>

<p1>Save the children works towards helping children and securing their education. Every year the
    organization reports children who drop out from schools all around the world. They have most of the
    data, but lack a way to reach the right and influential people, who can help resolve this issue. That is
    why our group will focus on African countries who struggle with issues like these. We will introduce
    an IT-system, or a platform that will collect and process every piece of data collected so it reaches the
    right people. We will introduce a combination of an existing system, and our system, that will make it
    more efficient.
