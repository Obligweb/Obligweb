<h3 id="Goal">Our Goal</h3>
<p1>
    Save the children works towards helping children and securing their education. Every year the
    organization reports children who drop out from schools all around the world. They have most of the
    data, but lack a way to reach the right and influential people, who can help resolve this issue. That is
    why our group will focus on African countries who struggle with issues like these. We will introduce
    an IT-system, or a platform that will collect and process every piece of data collected so it reaches the
    right people. We will introduce a combination of an existing system, and our system, that will make it
    more efficient.

<h4 id="History">History</h4>
<p2>
    In 2012 Save The Children came in contact with the only teacher at one of their mobile schools in
    Babile. The teacher shared the reasons behind the number of children dropping out. Babile is a dry
    region, which leads to a lot of the students not showing up to school, and instead collect water and
    take care of their families. In other instances, girls down to the age of 14 get married before
    completing their education. Babile is a strip of land in Ethiopia, and in 2007 the country had a dropout
    rate of 60% in primary schools, and many other African countries struggle with the same issue.</p2>

<h5 id="Risk">Risk</h5>
<p3>We acknowledge that there are numerous risks involved in creating and distributing our project. For
    example, the data can be inaccurate due to corrupt governments who tamper with the data.
    Furthermore, the participation from teachers can be lacking if they are not obligated to use it. There is
    also concern to be raised around the pricing of the project, and the security of the data collected.</p3>


<h6 id="Financing">Financing</h6>
<p4>
    FSeveral humanitarian organizations already exist that finance humanitarian projects, such as GSK
    (GlaxoSmithKline), UNICEF, Humanitarian Innovation Fund. Banks such as DNB and World Bank
    could also be interested in funding the project as it could be beneficial to them, in terms of good PR.
    Private investors and crowdsourcing could also be a source of funding. Google and Microsoft could
    also be interested in sharing existing technology to analyze the data. The project could also be
    financed by cooperation between several humanitarian organizations and states.</p4>
